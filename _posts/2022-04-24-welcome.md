This is the first post on my new website, Thanks again to kitian616 (https://github.com/kitian616) for designing an amazing website.

  I'm quite new to making a website, I kind of needed to build one for other websites since they require them. either way I am really happy with the outcome, I spent alot of hours on this website so I don't intend to let this go so easily. I'm most likely going to use this website for buisness relavent topics, so your most likely going to see products/services on this website

  If your looking for more into my social life, you can check out my social media links in about me, since I do intend to keep my content creating a side career. I still love editing videos for people to watch, so I intend to continue doing that. but other than that, thanks for checking out my website. definitely stick around if your intrested in the topics, I plan on sharing in the future.
